/**
 * This class manages all record builders that are used while a single user transaction is running.
 *
 * <p>As a transaction is handled, it will create a record and receipt tracking what happened when the transaction was
 * handled. During handling, it may be that more than one additional "synthetic" record must be created. For example,
 * a "crypto transfer" may need to auto-create a destination account that does not already exist. This must be done
 * <strong>before</strong> the crypto transfer so that someone reading the resulting record stream will see the creation
 * before the transfer. This is known as a "preceding" record. Preceding records are unrelated to the main user
 * transaction, other than having been triggered by it.
 *
 * <p>Likewise, some transactions cause "child" transactions to be created. For example, a "schedule sign" transaction
 * may complete all required signatures and "trigger" a child transaction for actually executing the transaction that
 * was signed. Or a smart contract may invoke the token service, causing one or more child transactions to be created.
 * These child transactions <strong>are</strong> related to the user transaction, and are linked by the "parent
 * consensus timestamp".
 *
 * <p>Some kinds of child transactions are "removable". This is only needed in a very few special cases. Normally
 * preceding and child transactions are used like a stack -- added to the end and removed from the end. But some
 * "removable" child transactions can be plucked out of the middle.
 *
 * <p>After transaction handling, this class will produce the list of all created records. They will be assigned
 * transaction IDs and consensus timestamps and parent consensus timestamps as appropriate.
 *
 * <p>As with all classes intended to be used within the handle-workflow, this class is <em>not</em> thread-safe.
